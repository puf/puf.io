The annual Stack Overflow developer survey is a treasure trove of information for the data-curious geeks amongst us, and this year's edition is no different. It just came out, so if you didn't have a chance to check it out yourself yet, go do so now: [2025 Developer Survey][sods2025].

I always find myself comparing the new survey results to those from the previous year. And since Stack Overflow doesn't include a comparison feature in the survey results, I end up with lots of open tabs and screenshots. 

Here are some of the main things that stood out to me when I compared this year's survey with the [2024 Developer Survey][sods2024].

## Frequency of visiting Stack Overflow

The percentage of respondents that visit Stack Overflow daily or even multiple times per day dropped from 37.2% in 2024 to 24.9% in 2025.

Oh, and note the drastically reduced number of respondents here and in the later questions too.

## Frequency of posting to Stack Overflow

The percentage of respondents that participate in Stack Overflow (by posting questions, answers, or comments) dropped from 8.1% in 2025 to 4.0% in 2025.

## Most-used database

PostgreSQL continues to reign supreme, widening its lead on MySQL. I noticed that in general most database gained some percentage points this year though, which is interesting. Are more folks using multiple different databases than last year?

Personally I found the growth of BigQuery, Supabase, and H2 most interesting, but even Firestore is up a bit.

### Most used Cloud Platforms

It looks like Stack Overflow added a lot of options to this survey question, which explains the longer chart.

Fascinating for me was the drop in Vercel usage from 11.9% to 10.6%. Firebase saw a smaller drop from 13.9% to 13.1%. Supabase bucked this trend and saw an expected gain from 3.8% to 5.4%, which likely has something to do with their [successful attachment to vibe coding tools](https://puf.io/posts/vibe-coding-growth-effect-on-baas/).
