One of the more broadly applicable things I learned during [my decade on Firebase][puf-firebase] is to always take the long view what is happening in a community. Don't be afraid to react to the moment, but *also* build a mental model of the trends and patterns that are happening over time.

With Firebase we noticed the hype-cycle of new tech. Before Firebase joined Google we already were the darling of developer tooling; then we were acquired and (after some "Google will kill it" concerns) relaunched a much bigger Firebase in May 2016 and [we became the darling again][todo].

I remember an internal strategy paper from around that time stated our 3-year goal to "become the de-facto standard in mobile development". I thought at the time that this was overly ambitious, but it turns out it was spot on. In under 3 years Firebase became the most used mobile backend in the world. 

Yet in that time, the sentiment around Firebase had swung from "the best thing ever" to "Firebase sucks".

No matter what new feature or product we launched, the response was always "again no full-text-search". 

Were we launching the wrong features? Our usage kept rising consistently - if not on the new features, then on the existing ones. So while they complained about what we didn't do, developers were still using Firebase more and more. We were the de-facto standard in mobile development, but we were also the de-facto standard in developer hate. *lolfirebase*

Around this same time was also Flutter's initial rise to fame. Developers loved stateful hot-reload, the expressive UI as a function if the app state, and the ability to build apps for multiple platforms with a single codebase. It was the darling of the developer community. I honestly was a bit jealous at this time of the Flutter team and the love they were getting.


But then, as Flutter matured, the sentiment started to shift there too. Why is there no recommended state management framework? Why is there no built-in router? Why are your widgets so basic? Why is the documentation so bad? Why is the team not moving fast enough?

At this point I had recognized the trend: new tech attracts love, incumbent tech attracts hate. It's probably something with the tech adoption curve, but it's also more basic human nature. We like rooting for the underdog, and we like to complain about the incumbent.

[todo: show waveform of Firebase and Flutter sentiment over time]

I tried to use my experience to coach the Flutter team through this downturn: don't worry about the hate you get, it means that you're doing something right. The more mature and established your tech gets, the more people will expect from it. And that's OK. At this point: enjoy the success of the product, and don't let the hate get to you. Still listen to your community, but don't let the hate distract you from your goals.

At this point, given the amount of hate and doubt Flutter attracts at a constant rate, it's the de-facto standard in cross-platform mobile development.

And interestingly enough, we saw a change in sentiment around Firebase too. As other BaaS technologies matured, they started becoming the incumbent tech. Firebase was no longer the "evil empire", but rather the "safe choice" for developers. Or a new player for [hosting your Next.js app][app-hosting] without using incumbent Vercel, or for a [cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database][data-connect] without using incumbent Supabase.
