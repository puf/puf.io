I write a lot, and sometimes post it here. 

From 2007 until 2014 I wrote about many topics on [The Puf Principle](http://frank.vanpuffelen.net/). Most of my public writing after that can be found in Stack Overflow [questions](https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen?tab=questions) and [answers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen?tab=answers); really... **do** check them out as there's bound to be **something** useful in there. Mid 2024 I restarted writing about tech here on puf.io/posts.
