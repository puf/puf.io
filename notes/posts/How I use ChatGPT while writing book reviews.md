For those of you who follow me (either my [RSS feed] here or on socials), you probably know that I read a lot. In 2024 I read on average more than one book a week. And I posted reviews for most of those books here on puf.io and (in the second half of the year) on GoodReads and socials too.

Over that time I've "developed" a process to use AI/LLM as a tool to speed up my workflow. Specifically, I now use ChatGPT (and occasionally Gemini) to:

* Generate alt text for the book cover images\
  This was my first consistent use of AI for the book reviews, as I find it does a much better job than I do myself. I tend to describe images with way too much knowledge about their context, while for the most "equal" experience it should be a quite literal description. In other words, an alt-text should describe what a viewer sees, not what they think.\
  My process here is based on something I learned from [nohe]() when we write the blog post []() for Firebase. The prompt I use is:\
  "PROMPT"\
  I created a custom GPT for this in ChatGPT, so my workflow is that I copy/paste the book cover image into ChatGPT, hit enter, and then copy/paste the output back into my markdown.
* Generate a description for the book series\
  
* Generate a set of social posts for the review\


Note that in most of these cases, I use the LLM as a tool to generate intermediate output. As in: I take that the AI generates and extensively edit it into my own voice. Sometimes I copy only snippets from the LLM into my own sentences, at other times I copy/paste what the AI generated and then edit that into my own form.

One interesting experiment recently:

* After I'd written the review for [book]() I asked ChatGPT what it would change about that and why.
