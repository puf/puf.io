Hi there 👋. I'm Frank van Puffelen, more commonly known as **puf**, and I'm a Firebase engineer at Google.

I'm mostly known for [answering questions](https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103) on Stack Overflow, my monthly [Firebase Release Notes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-K7zZEsYLm9G2M1W5ztrDvMv-CiFzLM) videos, and as a speaker about Firebase and Flutter at large and small conferences around the world.

This is my personal web site, and yes indeed - it is rather bare at the moment...
