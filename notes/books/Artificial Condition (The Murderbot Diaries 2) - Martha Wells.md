So far I'd read book 1 (All Systems Red) and short story 0.5 (All Systems Red) in the Murderbot Diaries series, and neither of them really gripped me. I liked this second full book in the series better, mostly because of the fascinating interactions between the murderbot and the computer of the ship that transports it. The in-book plot was simple-but-satisfying, but the pan-series plot is also coming together. 

My main complaint for the series is that the  books are rather expensive for their length (>$10 per 150-170 page book). I'll probably finish the series, but at a slower pace than some of the other series I'm reading.
