Holy smoke, what a lot of pages!

Steven provides a fascinating personal view on all Microsoft Office versions up to 2007, and then Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. It's as deep a dive as you're ever going to get, from a man known for his attention to detail and for writing a lot of words.

Did I mention already: holy smoke, what a lot of pages?!?!

I loved learning all the details, but definitely feel like this book could have been a lot shorter and still cover the same material with the details it deserves. An editor could do wonders here, and might also catch some of the annoying typos and grammar errors that pop up too regularly.

Still... great read if you're into this sort of stuff. Just keep in mind...

Holy smoke, what a lot of pages!
