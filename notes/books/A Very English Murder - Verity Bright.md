A fun short mystery novel about an heiress who returns home after her father died, and witnesses a murder on her first night back. Fun, simple characters and a straight story without many unexpected plot twists. The only thing that annoyed me a bit was the "let's do something" attitude of the protagonist, as it made her feel more of a hindrance than a help to finding the murderer at times.
