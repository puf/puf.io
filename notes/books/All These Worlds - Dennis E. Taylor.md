![Science fiction book cover for All These Worlds by Dennis E. Taylor, featuring a vivid orange space scene with futuristic spacecraft flying toward a partially destroyed planet or megastructure. Dark silhouettes of space debris and structures frame the scene, and the title appears in large, bold, blue metallic text at the top.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1654566914i/35506021.jpg)

After a few other books I'm back to the Bobiverse, which follows a man (Bob) who becomes an AI and explores space using self-replicating probes, grappling with identity, ethics, and humanity’s survival across the galaxy.

In the third book in the series, Earth's situation continues to get worse; making it urgent to move the remaining people elsewhere. The number of Bobs continues to grow, and they continue to explore and colonize the galaxy. Howard's relationship with Bridget continues to deepen and evolve. And the conflict with the Others comes to a head, leading to multiple action scenes too.

This book (like the first 2) is just not my favorite style of SF. The very short chapters make it easy to read, but they lack density. I may complain that some books have too little plot for their length (like Sanderson's Stormlight Archive), but so far the Bobiverse has a bit too much plot for their length. That said, fun read... and book 4 is longer, so I'm curious to see what that changes.
