![Illustrated book cover for Awaken Online: Dominion (Book 4) by Travis Bagwell. The image features a stylized black silhouette of a figure with glowing eyes at the top, surrounded by swirling orange and yellow spirals that resemble flames or magical energy. The spirals flow downward, transitioning into the shape of a medieval-style castle with tall spires and battlements. The title is written below in bold, orange and black text. The overall design conveys a sense of mystery and power.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1551660886i/44154519.jpg)

In the [Awaken Online book series][series] by Travis Bagwell a group of highschool-age kids play an AI controlled virtual reality game.

[Dominion][dominion] is book 4 in the main story arc, but the 6th book in the series (there are some side-quests with half-numbers), and things are really heating up both inside the game and outside of it.

I love the pacing of this book. The plot progresses quickly in-game and a bit more slowly outside of it, which makes for a nice alternating pace. The in-game action scenes remain vivid, although they get a bit long at times. 

Nits:

 * I wish an editor had caught the number of times the "sickening pop" phrasing it used for Frank's knee inversion. üçæüòÇ
 * In each book in the main story arc the in-game action and events get bigger and bigger, so I wonder how much longer that can go on.

Those are just minor niggles though, and this was another solid entry in the very enjoyable series. Ten days for 800 pages is definitely above my average page-per-day count. ü§Øüéâ

Next up in the series is side-quest [Unity][unity] and after that comes [Hellion][hellion] in the main story arc. I added both to my "Want to read" list, but now first... some other books.
