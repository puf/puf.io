Also titled: The Moon Hoax or, A Discovery that the Moon Has a Vast Population of Human Beings.

![A vintage book cover titled "The Moon Hoax; or, A Discovery That the Moon Has a Vast Population of Human Beings" by Richard Adams Locke. It claims to be illustrated with a view of the moon as seen by Lord Rosse’s telescope. The cover includes ornate border detailing and states the price as one dollar, published in New York by M. Doolady.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394235462i/21116394.jpg)

This book reproduces a series of articles that were published in the newspaper The New York Sun in 1835, claiming that the eminent astronomer Sir John Herschel, using a gigantic new telescope at the Cape of Good Hope, had discovered life and civilization on the Moon. Despite it all being a fictional narrative, the book dives quite deep into the history of its characters, and then describes in detail what they purportedly observed on the moon through their giant telescope.

I found it important to read this mostly as a time-piece, as the initial half of the writing is rather dry and dated. Still… interesting to read 190 years later and realize what a stir this caused back in a time when it would've been impossible to quickly verify or dispel the hoax.
