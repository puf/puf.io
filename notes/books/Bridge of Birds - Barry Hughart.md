![Cover of the book Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart. The subtitle reads, "A Novel of an Ancient China That Never Was." The background features an illustration of a traditional Chinese landscape with mountains and a figure in flowing robes, possibly representing a character from the story. The color palette consists of muted tones with soft lines, reflecting an ancient artistic style.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327940289i/15177.jpg)

Bridge of Birds is a fun fairy tale set in China about the adventures of an old scholar and a strong young man on a quest to find a cure for the children from a village. I like how it blends myth, mystery, and humor and how the main story unfolds to its (somewhat predictable) climax, but found the lack of development in the main characters disappointing.

*I read this as the first part of this [Kindle edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12591118), but decided against reading the other two parts as they're rated much lower.*
