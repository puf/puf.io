This Booker Prize-winning book explores a dystopian Ireland, where a mother fights to protect her family as society unravels. Prophet Song explores resistance, love, and survival amid political chaos and fear. At times it's heart-wrenching, at others it made it hard to breathe - but always it feels way too aligned with the current climate in the U.S. ðŸ˜¬

The writing style is unusual, with no line or paragraph breaks, no quotation marks around dialogue, and often no attribution for who is speaking. This is clearly a stylistic choice, and while it may effectively create a stifling atmosphere, it also makes the book much harder to read than necessary.
