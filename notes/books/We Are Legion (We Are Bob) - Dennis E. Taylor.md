![Book cover of We Are Legion (We Are Bob) by Dennis E. Taylor. The title appears in bold yellow text with a stylized “I” in “Legion” resembling a circuit. The background depicts a spaceship flying through an asteroid field, with fiery projectiles or debris around it, set in a reddish-brown space scene. The author’s name is at the bottom in silver capital letters.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474344826i/32109569.jpg)

I've had the first four books in the Bobiverse series on my Kindle for a while, after an ex-teammate rated one of them, and I finally got started on them. The series follows a tech-savvy man (Bob) who becomes an AI in space, building self-replicating probes to explore the galaxy and save humanity. In this first book, Bob dies and awakens on 22nd century Earth as an AI, tasked with exploring space while navigating politics, war, and philosophical questions of identity.

This book definitely falls in the category of space opera, as Bob and his replicas quickly develop tech and explore the universe. The characters and stories remain rather shallow, but it is entertaining enough to make it a fast page-turner. Each chapter is told from the perspective of one of the Bobs, which makes it possible to cover a lot of places in a few pages - but as the number of Bobs increased, it started getting a bit confusing to me.

I'll gladly continue reading the next three books in the series, since they're already on my Kindle anyway, but I somewhat expect my rating for those to be quite similar. If you're in the mood for a highly readable, space opera series, you could do worse (but better too).
