![Book cover of Unseen Academicals by Terry Pratchett. The title is in large yellow and green letters, with a brown football above it. Multiple outstretched hands in varied skin tones and clothing styles reach toward the ball, suggesting a chaotic scramble.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388348045i/6250169.jpg)

I've been listening to Stephen Briggs's narrations of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels on Libro.fm, and sadly, this is one of the last ones I could find there. This was *not* one of my favorite Discworld stories, unfortunately, as most of the parts about football just didn't connect with me for some reason. 

All the characters are lovely as usual, both the ones from previous books (Lord Vetinari, Lady Margolotta, The Librarian, and even Rincewind from all the way back in the first Discworld books) and the newly introduced ones here (Glenda, Juliet/Jools, Nutt, Pepe). I really love them all so much! Hearing a familiar voice (well done, Mr Briggs) when a classic character finds themselves in a new story always brings a smile to my face.

So this leaves the book a mixed bag for me, with the first half being closer to 3 stars, but the latter half making up for that to round up to a 4 overall. Now, if anyone knows where I can find Discworld books narrated by Stephen Briggs that I haven't "read" yet, please hit me up on the socials linked above!
