*I listened to Cory Doctorow's narration on Libro.fm.*

Cory wrote a lot of books during COVID, and is releasing them at a steady pace. This is another one on how the internet and world are broken, and how to make it a better place. His theories on this are solid, but it could've fit in fewer books. ðŸ™‚
