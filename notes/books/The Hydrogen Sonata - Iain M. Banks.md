The Hydrogen Sonata by Iain M. Banks is the 10th and final book in his Culture series - an epic, far-future sci-fi saga centered around a post-scarcity anarchist civilization run by powerful AIs known as Minds.

In this book a civilization prepares to Sublime into a higher state of existence, but a buried secret threatens to derail their plans. Musician Vyr Cossont races to uncover the truth with the help of eccentric AIs.

The book didn't grip me as much as others in the series, as it switches between "spy mode" and "longwinded descriptions" far too much - but it was still a fun read. I continue to love Banks's vision on how AI may evolve (curious, playful, sometimes morally ambiguous) feels especially provocative in todayâ€™s climate of both optimism and fear.
