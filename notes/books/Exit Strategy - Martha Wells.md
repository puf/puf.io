![Cover of the book Exit Strategy by Martha Wells. A person in a space suit floats above a large spaceship docked at a futuristic station. The background shows stars and part of a structure extending into space. The title appears in large white text at the bottom, with the series name The Murderbot Diaries in yellow beneath it.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1518642623i/35519109.jpg)

I started reading the Murderbot series on the strong recommendation of a friend/teammate, and while I found the books enjoyable, I found it hard to justify their sticker price (they're pretty expensive for their length). A recent [Humble Bundle with all current Murderbot books](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/martha-wells-murderbot-and-more-tor-books) [^1] solved that cost "problem", so I can catch up with everyone's favorite, snarky killing machine.

Exit Strategy is another enjoyable episode in the series. Murderbot has wrapped up its (self-assigned) rescue mission (see [Rogue Protocol](/books/rogue-protocol---martha-wells)) and now needs to save its former human owner from the malicious corporation that's been hunting Murderbot too.

The book dives into Murderbot's continuing evolution and self-discovery. It is now starting to recognize "friends", and it's fun to read Murderbot's struggle with these concepts, as well as its feelings for other bots (I miss ART, the snarky transport ship!) I do find the overall plot across the books a bit hard to follow though, which is why this one rates lower than the previous book in the series.

Still... I like the evolving feelings and seeing some recurring characters to hopefully anchor the series, so: more Murderbot coming up on my e-reader soon.
