I wanted to like this more than I did. Tim is great at writing stuff that makes you think, and this is no different. But somewhere in the 6 years it took him to write this he decided to turn it into a rant on wokeness that is at least 200 pages too long - and comes across as very frustrated. The points he makes are valid and make me think, but... not as good a book as I'd have expected.
