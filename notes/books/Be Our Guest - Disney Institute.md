This is a book from Disney's training institute, explores Disney's approach to customer service and how other organizations can apply the same principles. It intermingles teachings with anecdotes about Disney's history with customer service, and how those lessons are still applied today. I much preferred the Imagineering book I recently read, which also covers some aspects of Disney's constant customer focus. Turning just that part into a self-training has not made it more inspiring.
