This series keeps not disappointing. There is consistent development in the characters, the plot thickens and deepens, and the mix of sci-fi and fantasy is always interesting (pulling up a system menu right after raising some undead? why, yes please!) 

This gets 4+ stars for me. Only it being a bit verbose keeps it from 4Â½ stars, which would put it in the ever-difficult "round up or round down" position. :)

I've got [book 3.5](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40956725-apathy) of the series ready on my Kindle, and look forward to finishing the rest of the series at a reasonable pace. :-D
