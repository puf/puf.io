![Book cover of Tongues of Serpents by Naomi Novik. The cover features two intertwined dragons, one golden and one black, encircling a round, glass-like frame showing a ship on a blue sea. The background has a textured, pale surface resembling sand dunes. The title is in large, bold red letters at the bottom, with the author's name in red above the dragons. A subtitle reads, "A Novel of Temeraire."](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1296236911i/7818666.jpg)

Temeraire by Naomi Novik is a series of historical fantasy books that reimagine the Napoleonic Wars with an air force of intelligent, talking dragons. The books follow Captain William Laurence and his dragon, Temeraire, as they navigate warfare, adventure, and deep friendship.

Tongues of Serpents is the sixth book in the nine book series, and plays out in Australia - where Laurence and Temeraire are exiled. They face the by now usual political intrigue, a trek across the continent, a rebellion for control of the colony, and a potential war with China. So yes, there's plenty going on in these pages.

New dragons pop up in this books, but I missed some of the dragons of the previous few books in the series. I hope the author manages to tie all of these separate characters and subplots together in the remaining 3 books in the series - that I look forward to reading.
