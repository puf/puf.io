This is the 13th book I've read in the Awaken Online universe about an online world in a virtual reality video game that is governed by an advanced AI and that has far-reaching consequences for (at least some of) its players. So far there have been three main plot arcs/character sets, and this book brings all of them together in a huge showdown.

The friend who told me about this series had been warning me about a cliff in the series, and it seems like I hit that drop-off with this book. It's still a great read and page-turner, but the long-term story has become too convoluted and the characters too all-powerful. It feels like watching some of the later Marvel movies: moving from one over-powered fight sequence into the next one, with relatively little plot progression.

The plot development that *does* happen is quite satisfying though, with Alex slowly turning into less of an a**hole, and Dom also finding more common ground with Jason (and Finn) by the end of the book. I have one more book to read before I'm all caught up with the series, and I look forward to seeing where the story leads us.
