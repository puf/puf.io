Brave New World was first published in 1932, and has long been a staple of high school reading list. It is set in a dystopian future (about 2600 or so), where society is engineered for stability through genetic manipulation. Individuality and emotion are suppressed until one man challenges the system, questioning its values.

I loved the world building, and how it addresses the rise of the consumption society and the loss of individuality (similar topics as Fahrenheit 451). I also liked the use of Henry Ford as a God like figure in this consumerist society, and the added irony and satire it allows (e.g. years are indicated as A.F.: After Ford). Though a product of early science fiction, the novelâ€™s warnings about conformity and technological control still feel strikingly relevant.
