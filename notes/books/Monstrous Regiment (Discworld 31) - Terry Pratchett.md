Another brilliantly funny story covering a (potentially sensitive to some people) social topic. In this case it's about a group of women joining the army while pretending to be men. All (initially) without knowing that of each other. Guaranteed slapstick level hilarity guaranteed.

The only negative thing I can say is that it's at time a bit too obvious, but it's so small that only a nitpicker would point it out. ;-)

The audio-edition was narrated by Stephen Briggs and thus as brilliant as always. There were a few tiny production errors, but again... nitpick much? 

Highly recommended, and also: I think I need to restock on Pratchett audiobooks. ❤️
