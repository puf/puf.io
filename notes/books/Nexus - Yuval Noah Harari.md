![Book cover for "Nexus" by Yuval Noah Harari. The cover features a pigeon standing in the center, with the title "Nexus" in large red serif font below. The subtitle reads, "A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI." A circular badge in the top right corner mentions the author as "The global bestselling author of Sapiens."](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1706097789i/204929010.jpg)

Starting off the new year with a great read that earns a top rating from me. Like Harari’s previous works, Nexus explores the history and evolution of humankind in a uniquely engaging way.

This book focuses on how humankind has gained—and continues to gain—immense power by building large networks of cooperation. Harari illustrates how the expansion of our ability to share information has driven the growth of organizational structures, evolving from towns to city-states, and eventually to continent-spanning nations. The book offers compelling examples of how information sharing has led to positive outcomes, as well as cautionary tales of when it has gone awry—and what distinguished those situations.

One of the book’s most powerful insights is the importance of self-correction mechanisms within information networks. Without these, networks stagnate or collapse, as Harari demonstrates through numerous examples.

I read Sapiens a few years ago but haven’t yet tackled Homo Deus. Nexus feels familiar in tone but distinct in focus, which made it an accessible and thought-provoking read. I found myself deeply reflecting on the first two-thirds of the book in particular, as its framing of historical events is both unconventional and compelling.

Interestingly, I kept shifting between Harari’s warnings about AI’s short-term risks and the more optimistic long-term outlook found in The Culture series. If we can navigate the pitfalls and avoid the slide into totalitarianism, the future holds the potential for fascinating times ahead.
