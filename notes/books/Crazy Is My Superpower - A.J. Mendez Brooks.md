![Book cover for Crazy Is My Superpower by AJ Mendez Brooks. It features the author standing confidently in a black tank top, jean shorts, and sneakers, with hands on hips. Bold yellow text reads "SUPERPOWER" with "Crazy is my" above it. Comic-style speech bubbles say: "How I triumphed by breaking bones. Breaking hearts. And breaking the rules." Pink radiating lines emphasize her pose.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475353533i/32327131.jpg)

A.J. is best known from her time as AJ Lee in WWE, where she really defied *all* stereotypes of what a female wrestler should look and act like. Her on-screen character was so cute-yet-crazy, that I somewhat assumed the person behind it might be the same.

This first half of the book covers A.J. pre-WWE life, which was rough. She was born into a family of teenage parents who struggled to cope. A.J. tells the story of her youth, with all the physical hardships and mental struggles included. The second half of the book covers her life as a pro-wrestler, but also dives deeper into her (and her mom's) struggles with bipolar disorder.

All-in-all a surprisingly easy read given the heavy topics covered, largely due to Mendez' lighthearted writing style and the books page count. Kudos for discussing mental health at length!
