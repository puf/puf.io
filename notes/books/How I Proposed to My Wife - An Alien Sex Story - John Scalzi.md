A short story after finishing the 1800 page behemoth [Hardcore Software](/books/hardcore-software:-inside-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-pc-revolution---steven-sinofsky/), this time from John Scalzi whom I mostly know from his [Old Man's War series](). This one is about a new editor at a magazine who gets tasked to write a story about dating aliens. It's a fun, quick read - with a surprise ending.
