Second edition of a book from 2010 about the problems wrought by mass incarceration in the US. Audio-reading this while also reading the above was definitely a fun clash of opinions. In fact, if they would set up a debate between these folks, I would love to hear/see that. This one is more on my "you should read this" list than WOP.
