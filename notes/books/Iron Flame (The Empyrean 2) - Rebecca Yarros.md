The Empyrean series that started with [Fourth Wing][fourth-wing], is a romance/fantasy saga set in a war-torn world where young dragon riders are forged through deadly trials. The series blends "romance" (here a euphemism for quite explicit sex scenes) with political intrigue, and high-stakes adventure.

This second book continues right after the cliffhanger-ending of book 1, with protagonist Violet's second year at the war academy. The internal and external threats escalate throughout the story, with many major twists and turns in the story to keep you on your toes.

I read the [audiobook][audiobook] version of this book, and loved this second book (definitely 4+ stars) as much as the first book in the series. The romance (read: sex) sections were less shocking this time around, but I'm still impressed how the narrator makes it through those. Then again, I'm equally impressed how she manages to keep everything flowing smoothly in the big (dragon) fight scenes. After the big final fight, this book again ended with another shocking plot twist. Fun!

I have [book 3][onyx-storm] ready to go in the [Libro app][libro], but will probably first read some books without bonded dragons, as it's been a bit much between this and the [Temeraire series][temeraire].
