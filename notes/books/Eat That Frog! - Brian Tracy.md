This book had been on my Kindle since 2012, and I *finally* got to it. Given that it's under 150 pages, that really should've happened sooner. :-)

It's a simple self-improvement book, with 21 rules to prevent procrastination. Most of it boils down to being action oriented, and being intentional about what you do and don't do. Outside of that, there's a lot of overlap with (what I know of) the Getting Things Done methodology: so writing things down, maintaining lists, and moving things aroond between those.

I found the title the most interesting. In itself it's a simple one: if you start the day by eating a live frog, everything else will seem easier after that. It had to remind me of my late father, who used to try to do his toughest phone calls of each day right after he started work in the morning - and how his day after that always seemed better.
