This was one was on a lot of top lists for the year, and the cover is very clickbaity - so I read it. It's about a caucasian writer who takes a book draft from her asian american friend who just died and publishes it was her own. An interesting concept with so-so execution. Not bad, but I'm not sure why it ended up with a Goodreads Choice Award. In short: I still trust the verdicts of y'all better than the community at large ðŸ™‚
