![Audiobook cover for "I Shall Wear Midnight" by Terry Pratchett, featuring a girl holding a glowing, fiery object in her hands. Small blue-skinned creatures with red hair (the Nac Mac Feegle) surround her. Text includes “Performed by Stephen Briggs” and “A Tiffany Aching Adventure.”](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348733084i/12074855.jpg  )

In Terry Pratchett’s Discworld universe, the Tiffany Aching subseries follows a young witch’s journey as she grows in power and wisdom—often aided (and annoyed) by the mischievous Nac Mac Feegle.

This is the fourth book in the Tiffany Aching subseries of 5 books. I've previously read The Wee Free Men (book 1, where Tiffany is 9 years old), and A Hat Full of Sky (book 2, Tiffany aged 11), but somehow skipped Wintersmith (book 3, age 13) - which I’ve now queued up on my device.

In I Shall Wear Midnight, Tiffany is 15-16 years old and has just become a fully accredited witch: The Hag of the Hills. She faces growing mistrust and hatred toward witches in her community, fuelled by a dark, ancient force that whispers thoughts into people's minds.  Tiffany must confront both supernatural evil and societal prejudice to protect her people and her identity as a witch. All the usual cast members of the series make their appearance, and Tiffany also forms a budding connection with Preston, a thoughtful young guard.

Like the others in this series, I thoroughly enjoyed I Shall Wear Midnight, especially Stephen Briggs’s vivid narration. I can't wait to catch up with book 3 and then finish the subseries with book 5 about Tiffany Aching.
