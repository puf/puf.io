![Book cover of Onyx Storm by Rebecca Yarros. The title is in large white letters over a dark, cloudy sky with stylized geometric and celestial designs. A silhouette of a dragon is centered inside a glowing circle. The tagline reads “Brave the Dark,” and a quote from Christopher Paolini praises the author’s dragons and magic. The author’s name is at the bottom.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1720446357i/209439446.jpg)

This is the third book in Yarros' series about bonded dragon riders that started with Fourth Wing. Onyx Storm picks up immediately after Iron Flame, continuing what increasingly feels like one long, serialized narrative rather than discrete volumes.

School's mostly over for Violet and her team mates, as they are now "fully" focused on the fight with the evil Venin - shadowy magic-wielders—and their monstrous creations. The plot still progresses at a good pace, but the length is starting to show. This episode (including the by now mandatory "OMG" cliffhanger at the end) felt more formulaic than before - and where previously I'd wanted to skim the sex scenes (hard to do in an audiobook), now I found myself wanting to skim other scenes too. Yes, Violet and Xaden's evolving love is a major plot arc of the series, but I really don't need that repeated *this* often!

The change in point of view that was also at the end of the previous books was expanded to one more character this time around. I continue to find that interesting, but wish that the author did more with that throughout the books, rather than just in the final few chapters. I found Onyx Storm an entertaining read, but I hope the series refinds the spark that made Fourth Wing so compelling.
