The sequel to Children of Time, and definitely another one that stretches the imagination. What I like about his stories is that they don't take the Star Trek approach that every alien species is humanoid, but investigates the problems/opportunities of completely different species interacting. I didn't enjoy it as much as CoT, but still highly recommended.
