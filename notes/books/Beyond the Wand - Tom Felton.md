This auto-biography of the actor who played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies is a 80% a string of lighthearted anecdotes, and 20% the story of mental struggles and self-discovery. 

Tom seems to be a good human, whose self-deprecating humor permeates both parts. Highly recommended, although I do wish that the first part would've been fewer anecdotes with some more meat on them.
