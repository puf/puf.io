![Illustrated cover for Terry Pratchett: The BBC Radio Drama Collection featuring a large ensemble of characters from Pratchett's Discworld series. The characters, drawn in a whimsical and detailed style, stand together on a barren landscape, with a large open book at the foreground. The title is displayed in bold, ornate lettering at the top, with the BBC logo in the upper left corner](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1536109717i/40249881.jpg)

This is a collection of 7 are audio play/drama adaptations of Pratchett books, made by/for BBC Radio. I've happily been working my way through the Discworld audiobooks for a while now, so I expected to love these adaptions too. 

It started out well, the audio quality and voice quality are great. But I found that the adaptations varied a lot in quality. 

The first book (Mort) I had consumed on audiobook recently, and it was a good calibration: these adaptations are way too short to do the story justice. That was fine on Mort, but I had a terrible time trying to make sense of Wyrd Sisters. Outside of these, the adaptions were OK on Eric, Small Gods and Only You Can Save Mankind, and I enjoyed Guards! Guards! and Night Watch (I'm a sucker for Vimes' stories). 

Overall though I would only recommend this to folks who've already read the stories and are looking for a short recap. I will happily resume reading the unabridged individual Pratchett works, narrated by Stephen Briggs.
