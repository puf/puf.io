James is a retelling of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, told from the enslaved Jim's point of view. The book is hilarious at times, thought provoking at others, and puts a modern spin on a classic story.

I don't recall ever reading the original Huck, so can't compare it to that - but I found myself laughing out loud at Jim's difference in speaking around white and Black folks, as well as reflecting on the slavery vs indentured servitude, and other aspects of human nature. I also read the 300+ page page-turner in 2 days, as more proof that I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
