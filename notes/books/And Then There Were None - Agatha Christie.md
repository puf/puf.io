Whatever title you read it under, this is one of the top-selling mystery books of all time. Christie's writing style is a bit cold at times, but the story was to die for (pun intended). Weirdly enough my kindle switched to the "you finished this book" popup before I read the "letter to the editor" which explains what actually happened, but luckily I caught it.
