I'm a voracious reader of books and articles, and write blurbs about that. I track and rate all books I read on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24654655) and have been writing short reviews for a few years now.

Books *with* a review have a 📝 icon next to them. If you want to respond to any of my reviews, click the social link at the top of that page.
