Let's see... this is the tenth book that I've read about the [Awaken Online universe](https://www.goodreads.com/series/196901-awaken-online) about an online virtual reality game world, and in this book the main characters of the two sub-arcs (Jason and Finn) finally meet and go to battle.

As usual in series of this type, the characters get more powerful in each book - so by now both Finn and Jason and the other characters in both their parties have gained ridiculous levels of power. As usual in LitRPG these are all nicely backed up by stats, but those don't nearly carry the same weight anymore as they did in the early books.

Still, the story remains great, Jason's assault on Finn's city is well written and has plenty of plot twists, and the ending left me eager to dive into the next installment.
