The Awaken Online book series by Travis Bagwell is about a group of people who find themselves in a virtual reality game called Awaken Online and the adventures they have there.

Apathy is book 5 in the series and is a side-quest from the main story, this one an origin story about the recently introduced character Eliza. While I like the main story better, the side quests help gain more insight into the different characters and build out the world a bit further than the main story arc already does.

The series continues to be a fun, original sci-fi fantasy romp, and I'll gladly continue with the next book in the series after I've read some other stuff.
