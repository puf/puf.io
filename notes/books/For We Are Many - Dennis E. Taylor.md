This is the second book in the Bobiverse series about a man (Bob) who becomes an AI in space, who builds self-replicating probes and guides humanity's survival across the galaxy.

In For We Are Many, Bob and his many AI clones expand their reach across space, aid human colonies, and both confront and embrace alien life forms. The Bobs also wrestle with philosophical questions about identity, purpose, and love - and what it means to be human.

While this continues to be a page-turner series, the stories remain pretty shallow. The love-triangle was interesting-but-predictable, and I found myself more invested in the adopt-a-Deltan arc of Bob-1. There are plenty of interesting arcs again, I just really wish there was more depth to (and of) these.
