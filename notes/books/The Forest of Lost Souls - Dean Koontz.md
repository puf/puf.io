While I rated none of Koontz's books I've read so far very highly, somehow he still shows up regularly on my reading list. So I guess he must be doing *something* right after all. :-)

This is a story about a woman in her late 20s who lives alone on a mountain and uncovers the plot that got her fianc√© killed, and now endangers her life and that of many residents of a nearby town. It's a fairly typical underdog-hero-stands-up-to-the-big-bad-bully story, but enjoyable nonetheless. I liked the straightforward plot, but felt that mixing in ESP and other supernatural elements was unnecessary.
