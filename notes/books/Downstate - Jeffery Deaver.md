The image shows a cornfield with a narrow path leading to a red barn in the distance, under dramatic lighting. The authorâ€™s name appears in large blue text at the top, and the title "Downstate" is in blue at the bottom.

Special Agent Constant Marlowe uncovers a conspiracy of human trafficking in rural Illinois in this fast-paced crime thriller. A fun, quick read/listen.

This is the second book about Marlowe that I read, and while I recall the based plot of the first book - I don't recall her at all. Well... I guess that tells you enough about the books already: they're fine page-turners, but nothing very memorable.

I listened to the Audible edition of this, as it came included with Amazon Prime.
