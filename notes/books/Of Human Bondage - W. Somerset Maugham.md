This review from GoodReads summarized it best: "THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A GUY WITH A CLUBFOOT HIS GIRLFRIENDS A BITCH" [sic].

Set in the early 20th century this is a really interesting read about the culture and people of those times. A bit cringy at times due to said guy's inability to see said girlfriend for what she is, but very entertaining overall.
