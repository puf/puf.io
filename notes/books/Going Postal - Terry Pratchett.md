I read the first two Discworld novels decades ago in Dutch, and was not overly impressed. I got this audio book by Stephen Briggs on the cheap, and.... it was awesome! I laughed out loud at so many of the little word jokes, and Briggs's accents are so good. I look forward to reading/listening to more of this.
