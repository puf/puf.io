Over the years I read a lot of books and even more articles about the early days of computers, but this one focused solely on Apple early days - which brought a lot of info I hadn't seen before. Originally written in 1984, and updated in 2005 - so it's a nice time capsule by now. The writing style was not great, but the info was worth it.
