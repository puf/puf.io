An entertaining, but much lighter rump. A man inherits an enchanted house, and a romance develops with his magic finding housekeeper as they fight her old nemesis.

I'd read one other of Holmberg's books (Paper Magician), and found it similarly: a fun read but lacking in depth somehow. Not bad, but I doubt I'll finish this series either. It's not bad, there's just so much else to read. ðŸ™‚
