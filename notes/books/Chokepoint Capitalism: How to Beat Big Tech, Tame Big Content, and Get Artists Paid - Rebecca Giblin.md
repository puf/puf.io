I like Cory's writing, as he has a quite clear take on topics I care about. I generally like his fiction better than his (longform) non-fiction, but this one was quite good.

It broke down a bit in the end on the hints on how to help bring change about, but overall a good overview with lots of examples how we screwed things up.
