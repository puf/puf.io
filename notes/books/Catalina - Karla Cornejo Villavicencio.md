Catalina tells the story of a girl who was moved from her native Ecuador to New York when she was 5 to go and live with her undocumented immigrant grandparents. The book covers Catalina's last year at Harvard, but also has plenty of flashbacks to earlier phases of her life.

The initial two-thirds of the book feel like a string of anecdotes from her life. There are plenty of linguistic gems in there, but I found that it lacked a cohesive story. The last third is more plot-driven, but lacked a real end to the story. It almost feels like the author decided to stop writing, rather than to finish the story.

Not a bad book, just not a great one either.
