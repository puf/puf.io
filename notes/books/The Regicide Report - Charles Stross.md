![Book cover for The Regicide Report by Charles Stross. The title appears in large white letters over a vivid purple and pink cosmic background with circular, arcane-style symbols. Silhouettes of two armed figures stand in the foreground above a cityscape. A quote at the bottom reads, “Brilliantly disturbing and funny at the same time” — Ben Aaronovitch, on The Laundry Files.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1750535199i/236955287.jpg)

The Laundry Files is a series of books about an occult agency of the British civil service tasked with preventing extradimensional Lovecraftian horrors from invading Earth - a process that is getting easier due to the increase in math and computer use.

The Regicide Report is the final mainline book in the series, and it brings most of the characters from the previous 13 books together one last time to save the Queen. Stross pulls out all the stops here, giving Bob and Mo all the opportunities to show their full powers, and the final few fights are MCU-level ridiculous as a result.

Overall, I thought it was impressive how Stross pulled so many characters from the other books into this story. Unfortunately, that means each of them has fairly little to do, but it was still nice to have them back for the grand finale. Not a bad end to the series at all!
