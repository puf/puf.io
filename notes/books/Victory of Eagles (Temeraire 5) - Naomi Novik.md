![Cover of the book Victory of Eagles by Naomi Novik. The cover features a red dragon with outstretched wings holding a banner that reads "A Novel of Temeraire." The background has a faded illustration of sailing ships. The title is in bold white letters at the bottom, and the author's name is at the top in red letters.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1296225836i/7120105.jpg)

The Temeraire series by Naomi Novik reimagines the Napoleonic Wars with an air force of intelligent dragons bonded to human captains. It follows Captain Laurence and his dragon, Temeraire, through war, diplomacy, and adventure.

Victory of Eagles is the fifth book in the series and deals with the invasion of the UK by the Napoleanic army, who are subsequently pushed back by the English army and their (more and more self-sufficient) dragons.

I liked Victory of Eagles better than [the previous book in the series](/books/empire-of-ivory-temeraire-4---naomi-novik), due to the continuing evolution of the dragons, and the introduction of a fun new character: Perscitia. I found myself chuckling more than once at the interactions between humans and dragons, and the dragons amongst each others. 

The main human character Laurence remains a bit of a drag down, but I look forward to picking up the next book in this eight book series.
