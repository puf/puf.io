Behind her is a soft, impressionistic background with birds and flowers.

Danny and Maeve are siblings growing up without their mother in an estate house near Philadelphia. In this book, Danny tells the story of their youth in the Dutch House, and the decades after they leave it. I listened to the Tom Hanks narration of this fictional drama.

The book mostly focuses on the relationship between Danny and his sister, and how that affects the people around them. It has all the drama you can expect, with them starting from wealth, losing all of that, and then each rebuilding it in their own way (and together).

I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second half, because their constant dwelling on their youth and trying to either justify or right the wrongs that they experienced got tiring. Hanks' narration was good, but not spectacular - which I found fitting for the book. :-)
