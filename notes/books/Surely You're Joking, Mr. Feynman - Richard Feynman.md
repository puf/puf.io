Richard Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, Nobel Prize winner, and gifted teacher, best known for his work in quantum electrodynamics, his engaging lectures, and his playful, curious personality.

I expected this book to be a guided tour through some of his work and his teachings, but it turned out to be more of a memoir told through anecdotes. Now, Feynman was a gifted speaker and writer, but hundreds of pages of single-page anecdotes were a bit much for me.

The stories are always entertaining and cover small aspects of a lot of Feynman's life. I mostly enjoyed the chapters that went a bit deeper into a single topic, such as the experience on the Manhattan project - trying to do research while the Los Alamos site was still being constructed.
