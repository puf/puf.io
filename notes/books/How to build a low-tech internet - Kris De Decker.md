A collection of articles from [Low-tech Magazine][ltm] (LTM) on how to become less tech-dependent. The main articles are about LTM's solar-powered web server, which are fascinating on their own. I mean: dithering images to B&W to save energy? Such a neat trick, which also happens to help readability on my B&W e-reader.

I also thorougly enjoyed learning about the [optical telegraph][ot] systems of the 18th century (and how closely the [Clacks][clacks] in Terry Pratchett's Discworld is based on it), and [compressed air energy storage](caes). All in all, a fascinating book - which lead to many more articles being added to my reading list.

Note: you can read all the articles for free on [Low-tech Magazine][ltm], this ebook is just a bundling that I could more conveniently read on my Kindle.
