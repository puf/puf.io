![Book cover of Nation by Terry Pratchett. A silhouette of a boy stands on a beach holding a spear, facing a glowing full moon over the ocean. Tropical foliage and colorful birds frame the scene, including a parrot and a toucan. The author's name appears prominently at the top, with the title at the bottom.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1338831278i/2424593.jpg)

A boy named Mau finds himself the lone survivor of his island tribe, and meets a girl who was shipwrecked on the island by the same tsunami. The boy discovers his powers (including how to milk a pig), which also helps the girl discover hers - and together they build a nation from the survivors from all over the island region.

This is not a book in Pratchett's long-running Discworld series, but of course it still has all the hallmarks of the stellar writer. It's dripping with humor (seriously: how do you milk a pig?), challenges the accepted dogmas (including the various gods and religions), and shows the power of human connection in a unique way. Given all those, does it really matter what fictional world it's set in?

I listened to the Stephen Briggs audio-book version of Nation via [Libro.fm](https://libro.fm).
