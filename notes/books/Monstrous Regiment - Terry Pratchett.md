Whether plants are living, thinking, and sentient is a fascinating topic and the (audio)book initially gripped me. So many fascinating findings from plant scientists around the world!

As I got further along though, I found it harder and harder to stay focused. I'm not sure what that is, but it probably could've been a bit shorter - and all authors should consider whether they are really the best person to read the audio editions of their book.
