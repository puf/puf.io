The image shows a futuristic industrial setting with metal walkways and scaffolding, and small figures walking in the distance. The author's name appears in large yellow letters at the top. A yellow circle on the left reads “A Murderbot Diaries Short Story.” Text below highlights the book as Hugo and Nebula Award-winning and a New York Times bestselling series.](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1618841008i/57623348.jpg)

The Murderbot books are being turned into a TV show on Apple TV+, so are likely getting a lot more attention in book form nowadays too. An advantage of that is that there was a Humble Bundle recently where you could get all of the series for a reasonable price. And since price was one of the reasons I'd been pacing myself on Murderbot books, I couldn't pass that one up.

This 19 page short story sits between Exit Strategy (book 4) and Network Effect (book 5). It's not a bad story, but it didn't add much to the series for me. I'm moving on to book 5 right away, hoping that'll get me back into the mood that I had around Rogue Protocol (book 3). Can I haz ART back?! 😂
