I only started reading Christie a few years ago, and loved her whodunnit books so far. This was not my cup of tea though. The short stories have too little space for character and plot development, leaving me either dumbstruck with who had done it or (occasionally) seeing it from a mile away. I'll stick to her full length stories from here on.
