![Book cover of The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang. The title is in large black and red letters over a background of swirling black and red smoke. At the bottom left, a monochrome illustration shows a young woman in motion, holding a drawn bow and arrow, with wind-blown hair and robes. The tagline reads: ‚ÄúThey trained her for a war. She intends to end it.‚Äù](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515691735i/35068705.jpg)

The Poppy War is the first book in R.F. Kuang's historical fantasy trilogy inspired by 20th-century China, especially the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Opium Wars. The title references a series of devastating wars and the central role of opium in the plot - tied to power, addiction, and divine possession.

In this book, peasant girl Rin passes the Keju test to get into a prestigious academy, where she doesn't fit in but wins the first year's main trial against all odds. 

Many of the plot elements reminded me of [The Fourth Wing][fourthwing], but I guess there's only so many ways to write a book about 'coming of age at a school of magic'. No Potter wands, bonded dragons, or extended 'romance' scenes here though! ü™Ñüêâüôà

As with Kuang's [Yellowface][yellowface], I found it difficult to connect with Rin. She comes across a bit too whiny, and self-pitying - and I found most characters lacked emotional depth. They're interesting archetypes though and the plot itself sped along really nicely. I have the rest of the [audiobook trilogy][trilogy] ready to go on my Libro.fm app, so expect reviews of the other two books in the coming months.
