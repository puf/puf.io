*The Hardcore Truth: The Bob Holly Story is an autobiography that delves into the life and wrestling career of Bob "Hardcore" Holly, offering an unfiltered look at the highs and lows of his time in WWE.*

I've been watching pro-wrestling on TV for many decades by now, but this is the first time I read a wrestler's biography. Bob is not the most famous wrestler, but he has a long experience and thus lots of anecdotes to share.

I loved the small insights this book offers in the work of a wrestler (travel arrangements, etc). But in the end I felt a bit let down by the lack of depth in most of the stories, and the hard opinions (good and bad) about the people in the business and/or their behavior towards Bob.

A good, quick read, but nothing more.
