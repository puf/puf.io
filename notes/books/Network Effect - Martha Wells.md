![Book cover for Network Effect by Martha Wells. A lone figure in a spacesuit stands on the surface of a spacecraft, gazing up at a massive, shadowy spaceship above. The background is a hazy, green-tinted space scene. Text reads: “Martha Wells,” “Hugo and Nebula Award Winning Series!” “Network Effect,” “A Murderbot Novel,” and “The New York Times Bestselling Series.”](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1640597293i/52381770.jpg)

The Murderbot books follow a self-aware security robot on its journey towards continued freedom and self-discovery. This is the fifth full book in the series, the first book of which is being turned into a show on Apple TV.

In Network Effect, Murderbot's routine mission with its human companions is violently disrupted when they're attacked and pulled into a wormhole by a hostile ship. Things get more complicated as it turns out there's a connection to ART and its crew. Yay, ART is back!

I love how the series continues to explore the emotional development of Murderbot, in its relation to humans as well as other AIs. Despite itself, Murderbot keeps making new friends (like Amena and Three) and deepening its bond with existing characters (like Dr. Mensah and ART). Great read, and I look forward to the next book in the series.
