This is the final book in the [Temeraire series][temeraire], which blends Napoleonic-era warfare with fantasy, following British captain Will Laurence and his dragon. Across eight books, they battle in global conflicts, challenge imperialism and slavery, and fight for dragon rights and equality.

*League of Dragons* begins in the aftermath of Napoleon’s retreat from Russia. Laurence and Temeraire face Napoleon’s final push for domination - which ends as you'd historically expect. The book resolves long-running tensions over dragon rights (with dragons in parliament!), loyalty between dragons﹠humans, and leadership, delivering a thoughtful, action-filled conclusion to the series.

I really liked this series of books, especially given the long-term story arcs on dragon rights, human﹠dragon loyalties, and the folly of war. The story is not necessarily done/done, but I'm glad that this final book didn't leave too many threads dangling. If you like dragon fights, the Napoleonic times, and human/dragon bonding - this series is highly recommended.
