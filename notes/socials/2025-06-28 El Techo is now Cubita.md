Having a drink and/or bite on the rooftop of El Techo has long been a staple of many a must-do-in-sf list. The Mission District rooftop was a great way to combine scenic views of the San Francisco skyline with some hipster staring/sharing, and good drinks.

Well... not anymore! El Techo closed in May and was transformed into a new rooftop spot: Cubita.

 Honestly, if you ignore the signage you can still imagine being at the same spot, as the food style and drinks quality are unchanged - unsurprising as Cubita is operated by the same owner as before, whose group also runs  Lolinda, Beretta, Flores, A Mano, and Delarosa.

So go check out the new Cubita bar/restaurant on 2516 Mission Street in San Francisco’s Mission District. New name, new food menu, but same vibe and gorgeous views!
