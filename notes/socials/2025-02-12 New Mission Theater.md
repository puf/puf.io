The [New Mission Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mission_Theater,_San_Francisco) on Mission street in San Francisco has had many different uses since it was constructed in 1916. It's been in use as an [Alamo Drafthouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jYktcSjmWhQ5HDfq8) movie theater since its renovation 2015, but it's been a children's theater and a furniture store too.

The Alamo Drafthouse New Mission also has a bar/restaurant, and a surprisingly good selection of pinball machines - including this Aerosmith machine that I scored nicely on.
