The Holiday season is arriving rapidly around Union Square in San Francisco!

When you walk along Powell Street between the Cable Car turnaround and Union Square you can now see eight giant, christmas ornaments displayed on the street.

There are always large public art pieces on this part of Powel, but I'm glad they turned them seasonal again.

And of course, once you get to Union Square itself it's impossible to miss the giant 83 foot (25 meter) Christmas tree.

There's an ice rink too, and the entire area is doing its best to be extra festive.

So if you're spending some time in San Francisco this Holiday, consider visiting the area around Union Square!
