The Tenderloin is a famously gritty district in San Francisco, known for its classic concert venues (such as the [Great American Music Hall][gamh]), historic theatres, and its colorful streetlife. Yes, that's a euphemism indeed: lots of the more vulnerable residents of San Francisco call the Tenderloin their home.

On the corner of Leavenworth and Eddy you can find the [Tenderloin Museum][tmo], which aims to explain (and in their own words: celebrate) the rich history of one of San Francisco's most misunderstood neighborhoods.

Right near the entrance it explains where the name comes from: the bribes allowed the police chief to upgrade to a better class of meat for their meals. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥©

The rest of the museum is a large room with lots of photos with captions, and plaques explaining the history of the neighborhood. The earlier ones of these explain how the Tenderloin became the bustling center of single-room occupancy hotels, and how it's been fighting since the 80s to keep the high-rent high-rises at bay:

There's no better way to show love for the Tenderloin than this quote from Herb Caen:

The Tenderloin museum is not big (we covered the majority in about an hour), but it gives a great insight into the (history and origin of the) neighborhood. Admission is $6-$10 per person, and it's well worth the time and price to learn more about this much maligned district.
