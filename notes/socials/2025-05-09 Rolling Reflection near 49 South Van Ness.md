As I was walking home from Pacific Height to the Mission in San Francisco recently, I grabbed coffee at the [Blue Bottle on 55 S Van Ness](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XySXxLPE26s4srXV7) and as I exited the shop I noticed these fascinating art works:

So I took the slight detour towards the 49 South Van Ness government building that houses the San Francisco Building Inspection, San Francisco Planning Department, and more public works.

From a quick search it seems that this is an artwork by [Theresa Zingg] and is called [Rolling Reflection](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rolling-reflection-san-francisco). It's in the pedestrian alley connecting South Van Ness with Mission Street, so you can get to it from both directions and easily reachable from Market Street too.

While the outward facing parts of the shapes are painted in highly saturated colors, their inside are made of mirrors. So while their colorful outsides are what initially draws attention, its their other side that leads to fascinating reflections.

Definitely worth a quick detour if you happen to be passing by this part of the city.
