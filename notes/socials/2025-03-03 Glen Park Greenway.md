San Francisco is a wonderful city for those who like to walk and explore - not just for its large number of well-known tourist attactions, but also because of its many lesser known greenways. Since 2019 the site [crosstowntrail.org][ctt] helps folks explore the city, with a 17 mile beautiful route from [Candlestick Park][candlestick-point] in the southwest of the city to [Lands End][lands-end] / [Sutro Baths][sutro-baths] in the northeast. I really need to tell you more about that at some point, maybe after we've had a chance to re-explore it.

One of the new-to-us greenways we discovered when we first did the crosstown trail in 2019 was the [Glen Park Greenway][gpg], a 3-block strip right below Bossworth street from Brompton avenue to Burnside Avenue. If you take the BART to Glen Park station, you can get to the greenway in a minute and then walk to Glen Canyon Park mostly without any traffic.

After 3 blocks on the greenway you encounter this impossible-to-miss Burnside Avenue mural and the mosaic stairs above it.

Until [late 2024][sfc] this was just a concrete, partially green staircase to climb to Bossworth street, but now it is yet another reason to explore the Glen Park Greenway - and many other parts of the city.
