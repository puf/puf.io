If you ever find yourself spending a night (or just a few hours) at JFK airport in New York, check out the [TWA hotel](twahotel.com) in terminal 5. How to get there? Follow these instructions:

OK, that map is a bit much - so I asked one of the friendly folks working JFK, and they told me to go the luggage carousels, and then follow the TWA Hotel signs to the elevator, which takes you to the skyway and back to the 60s:

Right outside of the elevator is a reproduction of Howard Hughes' office:

It's like you're transported back in time with the music, but especially with the styling. Like this ramp taking you into (and out of) the hotel:

The entire hotel gave me Disney vibes, despite not being about any cartoon character. I think it's the immersive environment, and great attention to detail. Oh, and there are plenty of spots to hide from everyone and get some of your writing done too üòÖüëã.

There are old car experiments, lots of vintage posters, and a rooftop pool with a view of the planes. Combine that with a constant barrage of 60s tunes and I had a blast: so go explore!

The uniforms range in colors and styles, including blue, green, yellow, and coral outfits, some with hats and scarves. The display sits on a white platform with period luggage and bags placed around it, set against a red carpet and curved architectural backdrop.](https://i.imgur.com/NCgergb.png)
