On a hike today I bumped into this beautiful stairway:

Meet: Tompkins stairway, one of the many community-built, colorful stairways in San Francisco. This one is on the eastern edge of Bernal Heights and consists of four stairs with a total of 66 steps.

[Tompkins stairway](https://tompkinsstairs.org/) was opened in 2019, and they hold regular [events](https://tompkinsstairs.org/events/).

It's one (pretty steeply uphill) block from the Alemany Farmers Market, so if you ever find yourself in that area and fancy a bit of a climb: don't miss this beutiful piece of San Francisco.
