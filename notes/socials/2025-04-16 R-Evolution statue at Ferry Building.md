Last week I was in Las Vegas en happened to notice this statue in [The Park][the-park] right off of The Strip:
![Bliss Dance statue in The Park, Las Vegas](https://i.imgur.com/cKTGm5T.png)

This sculpture is called [Bliss Dance][bliss-dance] and was made by [Marco Cochrane][artist] for Burning Man back in 2010.

Much to my surprise, I saw that an equally large statue from the same artist was just put up in front of the Ferry Building in San Francisco. So this past weekend we went to check it out.

The Ferry Building is always a gorgeous sight, as it's clear gray outline looks great against San Francisco's usually bright blue sky.

But now when you look from the Ferry Building towards Market Street, you see a new statue. It looks quite small here, but that quickly change as you get closer.

This sculpture is called R-evolution and was made for Burning Man in 2015. It stood in Florida until last year, and was supposed to go up on Union Square - but somehow it ended up in front of the Ferry Building.

The arrival of R-evolution to San Francisco was celebrated with a dance party on April 10. I missed the party, but luckily NBC Bay Area posted about it: [San Francisco unveils massive new sculpture near Ferry Building][article]. 

The statue will stay in its current location for 6 to 12 months, something I'm sure neither the statue nor the San Franciscans will complain about that.

For one hour per day the statue will seem to be breathing with a rising and falling chest, and at night it is illuminated. Well, I guess we'll have to go back at night to admire that. :-)
