The Van Ness Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a 2-mile, dedicated bus-lane on Van Ness Avenue (US 101) from Mission street to North Point street. Its main feature is the center-running red-colored lane over which busses zoom me to my destination, but when I walk along Van Ness I also appreciate the public art that was part of the project, which opened in 2022.

At the intersection of O'Farrell and Van Ness are these beautiful giant 'lollipops' by artist Jorge Pardo. Of course, the building in the Classical Revival architectural style in the background doesn't hurt either. 😍

*Hmm... it seems like that [building is up for lease soon](https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/999-Van-Ness-Ave-San-Francisco-CA/23782697/) 🤔*
