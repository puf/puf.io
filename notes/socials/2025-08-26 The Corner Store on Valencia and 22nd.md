Anyone who's lived in the San Francisco Mission district for any amount of time can probably tell you about [Lucca Raviolli][lr] on the corner of 22nd street and Valencia street.

The Italian deli was a staple until its closure in 2019. Since then the mural is the only constant reminder of the lines that Lucca used to attract.

The corner store has now been picked up Square (makers of point-of-sale devices) who have renamed it to [The Corner Store][tcs] (duh) and have been [hosting short-term pop-ups in there][square-tcs] since May 2025.

After two coffee pop-ups (the last one from NBA player [Bigface][bigface]), this week the site is opening [York Street Collective][yssf], which adds art and non-alcoholic cocktails to the coffee mix:

They're opening on August 28 and are apparently staying until December. If the previous pop-ups were any indication, I expect this one to draw long lines again.
