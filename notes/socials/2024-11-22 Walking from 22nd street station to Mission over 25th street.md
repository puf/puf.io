On my weekly commute from the 22nd street CalTrain station back to 22nd and Guerrero, I was about to take the [route over Cesar Chavez](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Pk4S9bEFwQpbVp6H9) that [I'd done before](/socials/2024-08-14-walking-from-22nd-street-station-to-the-mission-over-cesar-chavez). But then when I got to the corner of Pensylvania and 25th, I decided to turn right. I mean, how bad could it be, right?

Well... this rutned out to be my least favorite route so far. Not only was it more hilly than any of my previous routes, but there was also very little scenic about it. Here's the route I ended up taking:

And here's the up-and-down of it:

Hmmm... that doesn't look as bad as it felt. üòñ

Adding it to the table as usual get us:


| Route    | Distance | Time   |
| -------- | -------- | ------ |
| 22nd st  | 1.8 miles| 45 min |
| Chavez   | 2.8 miles| 50 min |
|          |  +55%    | +11%   |
| 17th st  | 2.9 miles| 55 min |
|          |  +61%    | +22%   |
| 25th st  | 2.5 miles| 50 min |
|          |  +39%    | +11%   |

So it's a lot shorter than the route over Chavez, but not any faster (due to the steeper incline/decline).

One of the fun discoveries on this route was [this apartment building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1t9qpUB4SiacPFVJ8):

I usually see this complex from Chavez, but now I got up close: note the 4 levels from the 25th street entry to the back of the building. The height differences in San Francisco make for such fun architectural challenges. üåÅüöû

From Wisconson to Deharo street, the walk over 25th street was more scenic again  with trees on both sides:

The end of this stretch is the steepest decline though, and my knees definitely started hurting there.

Then from Kansas street on, it was pretty much the same route as when I walk over Chavez:

So, I discovered some new bits of San Francisco on this route, but I'm also pretty sure that I won't see those bits regularly from now on. üòä
