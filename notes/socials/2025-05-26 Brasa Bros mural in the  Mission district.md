San Francisco in general is known for its many murals, but the Mission District especially has turned this art form into its greeting card. Every week new murals get unveiled, often replacing previous ones.

Local shops and restaurants get into it too, because the murals combine advertising, with supporting local art, and preventing grafity from taking over the walls.

When Peruvian restaurant Limon closed its Van Ness location in early January, it didn't take long for the windows to start showing "Brasa Boys - coming soon".

Things is... we apparently have a different definition of "soon" as it's been 3 months and they're still not open. But there is regular activity in the store and they just put up this **gorgeous** mural, so I can't really complain... too loudly.
