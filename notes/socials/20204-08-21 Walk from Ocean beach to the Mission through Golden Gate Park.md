Last Sunday we walked from the [Beach Chalet](https://www.beachchalet.com/) at Ocean beach back to our home in the Mission. It was a beautiful route through Golden Gate Park, Haight Ashbury, Lower Haight, and Laguna and Valencia street.

The drive out by Waymo took 30 minutes, including the delay I mentioned in [Waymo stuck behind parked church cars](/socials/2024-08-19-waymo-stuck-behind-parked-church-cars).

Then we walked a very similar route back. First we walked over JFK through Golden Gate Park, which is *so* beautiful without any cars. There's more street art on JFK now, like this:

And of course there was the [Lindy in the Park](https://lindyinthepark.com/) crew, despite these very explicit signs about NO DANCING!

After Golden Gate Park, we walked Haight Ashbury, and Lower Haight, finally turning right on Laguna to make it back home.

The walk back clocked in at 3 hours, including a few (restroom and coffee) stops. A bit longer than the 30 minute Waymo ride out, but a great sight seeing walk in our beloved SF.
