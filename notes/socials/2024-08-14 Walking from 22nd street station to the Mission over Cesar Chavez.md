On my commute back yesterday, I walked from 22nd street station to the Mission (22nd and Guerrero) over Cesar Chavez. Last time I did this all over 22nd, but I wanted to avoid the steep climb with this detour.

It definitely is a detour as this clocked in 1 mile (>50%) more than my original route. That said, since there was hardly any climb on this route, time-wise this only took me 50 minutes (11% more than the 45 minutes for the route over 22nd took me). Yup, I indeed walk pretty fast. 🚶💨

| Route    | Distance | Time |
| -------- | ------- | ---- |
| 22nd st  | 1.8m    | 45 min |
| Chavez   | 2.8m    | 50 min |
|         |  +55%    | +11% |


Not a bad commute, but I might do 17th street next time. That one I’ve done a lot more frequently, so it won’t feel as much like “exploring” in my own city. :)
