If you've been to Union Square in the past few years, you probably noticed the beautiful heart statues that are on its corners.

But this week I noticed a completely differently shaped statue on the [NW corner of Union Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oC7uKAnBHX9NJ4qt6):

Yup, that is indeed a snake - and it was installed on January 18 to celebrate the lunar new year that started the year of the snake.

According to [this article](https://sf.funcheap.com/sfs-2025-lunar-new-year-snake-statue-parade-jan-18-mar-2/) the statue will be on display until March 2, so go see it while you can.
