Filoli is a historic estate 45 minutes soutch of San Francisco, featuring a 54,000-square-foot Georgian-style mansion and 16 acres of formal gardens. Itâ€™s part of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and serves as a public garden, museum, and event venue.

Six giant wooden [trolls moved into Filoli][ssf] in June to liven up the already gorgeous park. They apparently will move out by November 10, yet somehow we only made it down to greet them this weekend.

The smallest troll stands near Filoli's main building to welcome you in, and the other five are spread out around its redwood forest area. The next one we found guides guiding you to the scenic trail, by listening conspiciously to the sounds of the earth:

This next troll was my favorite, as it's on a mission to spread birdhouses in the forest. It's already put up hundreds of them although most seem uninhabited for the moment.

The final one I caught on "film" was putting plans into a car when we saw her:

All trolls are easy to find, welcome to the touch, and we saw kids climbing on some of them (not sure if that's encouraged or not, but nobody told them off).

When you've head enough of the trolls, there is still much more to see, such as the hundreds of thousands of pumpkins all around the park:

You have until November 10 to catch the trolls, but even after that: Filoli is always worth a visit if you're in the area.
