After standing under a plastic cover for a while, I just noticed that the sculptures at the 101 underpass on 17th street in San Francisco are now unwrapped.

The metal sculptures loop beautiful in the bright spring sunlight. There are two sculptures on the western side of the 101, in the Mission/Mission Creek district and two more on the eastern side, in the Potrero Hill area.

These are the two sculptures on the western side:

There's a sign that says:

> ## Metamorphosis
> Artists: Jason Kelly Johnson & Nataly Gattegno\
> Futureforms
>
> The word Metamorphosis originates from ancient Greek (...) meaning 'transformations'. The Potrero Gateway sculptures consist of four stacked spherical figures which emerge from the terraced gardens located on either side of the 101 Freeway. The sculptures transform and dematerialize into intricate lattices as
they grow towards the sky. The uppermost forms were computationally derived and evoke the microscopic cell structures of radiolaria and other organic sea forms that
would have been found at this location as late as 1850. Prior to urbanization the site was on the marshy shoreline of Mission Bay which would have been teeming with mollusks and other sea creatures.

Sure, lots of words - I mostly just like that they put up artwork in this otherwise somewhat empty area that I walk and bicycle by regularly.

These are the two sculptures on the eastern/Potrero Hill side of 101:

More artworks in the city? Yes yes please!
