When I was at Musée Mécanique early November, there was a crew working on a new giant sculpture - of a fish:

When we passed by pier 45 yesterday, the statue was all done - and looked much more menacing. From a distance it looks a bit like a (blue) whale who's riding a wave, but when you get closer the triangular teeth in its mouth make it clear that this is a shark.

This sculpture is called "Desert Shark" by artist [Peter Hazel](https://www.peterhazel.com/). If you click through to his site, you can see how it got its name-that-makes-no-sense-where-it-is-now: the 25’ long, 15’ wide, and 8’ tall shark was created for display at Burning Man 2022, and has only now been moved to San Francisco as part of the [Big Art Loop](https://www.bigartloop.org/).

Apparently it has LED lighting too, so if you're every around there at night: snap a pic and send it over to me!
