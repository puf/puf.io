If you've ever spent some time in San Francisco you've probably seen some of these large heart statues, like this one on Union Square:

This sculpture is called Butterflight and is part of the [Hearts in San Francisco][heartsinsf] public art project that's been running for over 20 years. New hearts are added each year, and some hearts are also [sold][heartssale] off regularly. 

Currently there are over 100 of these large hearts to be found in public places all over SF right now. You can find all of them in this [hearts gallery][heartsgallery] or see them on this map of hearts:

Or do as I've been doing, and admire them when you randomly bump into them on a city hike. Here are a few of my more recent heart encounters:

* When we were visiting [Sutter Health on 1100 Van Ness][sutterhealthmap] recently (nothing serious, thanks for asking), we saw this gorgeous heart called "City Fruit" painted by prolific SF Mission artist [Sirron Norris][sirronnorris]:

* In [Francisco Park][heartinpark] you can find this beautiful chrome heart, that somehow is *not* on the map I included earlier. Hidden hearts! What will they think of next? ðŸ™‚

* Just like the Butterflight heart at the top of the article, this Tea Time with Laine is on [Union Square][unionsquaremap]. Or actually it *was* there, but it moved to New Hampshire now - the heart goes where the heart goes I guess.

Hmmm... I've definitely seen more than just these, so I need to get better at taking pictures of them. Do you have a favorite (or just a first) Hearts in San Francisco statue? Share it in the links above ðŸ‘†
