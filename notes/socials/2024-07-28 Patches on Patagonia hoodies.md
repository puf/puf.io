description: My Patagonia hoodies have holes in them from "backpack friction". Instead of throwing them away, I sew on patches to cover the holes. Over time, it's becoming quite the collection of patches. The blue hoodie is where it all got started, and when I still tried to color coordinate. The grey hoodie is more of a free-for-all. ðŸ˜‚

I've been wearing Patagonia hoodies for about a decade now. Unfortunately friction from my backpack causes holes on the back of the hoodie and they don't make them (or not my preferred colors/style) anymore.

My wife came up with the idea of adding patches to cover up the holes, and over time I gathered quite the collection. Here's my original blue one:

You can see from the pilfer that it has some more work coming up.

And here's my pride and joy, the back of my grey hoodie:

I just reattached the Amsterdam patch as it had come loose, and added the Google bike (gbike) as a new hole had sprung up. Also: there is indeed some triple layering going on there, so yay for needles that can handle that and a thimble to protect my fingers anyway. 

And yes, lots of pilfering here too, so at some point this hoodie will be mostly made of patches. I actually wouldn't mind that. ðŸ˜‚
