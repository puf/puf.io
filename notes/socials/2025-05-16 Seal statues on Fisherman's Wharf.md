As we were walking across [Fisherman's Wharf][fishermans-wharf] in San Francisco recently, I noticed this brightly colored status of a seal in front of the [SkyStar Ferris Wheel][skystar]:

I had to stop and get a better look at it, as it was much less noisy, smelly and likely to move than the sea lions you'd usually see on Pier 39:

It turns out that this statue is actually of a sea lion too (my bad), and it's one of 30 such statues that were placed (mostly) along Embarcadero in 2020 for the 30-year anniversary of the sea lions "invading" Pier 39 after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989:

For more details about these statues, read the SFGate article on [why 30 sea lions popped up around San Francisco in 2020][sfgate-article].

I was mostly drawn to the circle if colorful, numbered icons that this specific statue has on its chest. I couldn't quickly find any more info on this though, so if anyone knows what they mean - hit me up on the links at the top of this page üîù.

*Update*: It turns out those numbered icons are [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)][unicef-goals] that were [adopted by the United Nations][un-goals] back in 2015 to end poverty, reduce inequality and build more peaceful, prosperous societies by 2030. You can find more about these goals and the progress on the UNICEF site: [Using data to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for children][unicef-sdgs].
