On my commute back today, I walked from 22nd street station to the Mission (22nd and Guerrero) over Cesar Chavez. Last time I did this all over 22nd, but I was looking to avoid the steep climb with this detour.

It definitely is a detour as this clocked in 1 mile (>50%) more than my original route. That said, there was indeed hardly any climb on this route, so time-wise this only took 60 minutes (33% more than the 45 minutes for the route over 22nd took me).

The main issues is the weird pedestrian route where Chavez goes under the 101, and we have to take the stairs.

Oh, and Cesar Chavez itself is of course pretty boring, so I switched over to 26th street as soon as I could (after Potrero del Sol park).

Not a bad commute, but I might do 17th street next time. That one I‚Äôve done a lot more frequently, so it won‚Äôt feel as much like ‚Äúexploring‚Äù in my own city. :)
