Walking Divisadero from North to the South is always a fun trip, and if you stick to the western side of the street just south of Oak street you can't miss this wall full of rubber ducks:

You can find it on Google Maps as [duck wall][duckwall].

I'd walked by and photographed the rubber duckies many times before, but this was the first time I noticed the wooden sign:

Corny humor aside, there's something just plain fun about the duck wall. So go check it out when you have a chance.
