[Humble Sea brewing][humblesea] started in Santa Cruz back in 2014, and are known for their vibrant branding, ocean-referencing naming, and wide range of surprisingly drinkable beers.  We discovered them a couple of years ago at their original [Santa Cruz Swift street location][swift], but they've since opened a few more spots.

Early May Humble Sea opened their first taproom in San Francisco on historic Pier 39, smack in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf. The first time we went there they didn't have any food options yet, but the beer was good and the location is unbeatable.

Since last week there are QR codes posted on each table where you can order food from the next-door [Taco Cantina][tacocantina].

So you order and pay from your phone, and they bring the food to you while you're sipping beer. Yeah, indeed... there are worse days to spend an afternoon in San Francisco! üçªüåÆüåÅ
