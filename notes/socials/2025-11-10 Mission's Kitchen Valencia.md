When I walked by 1020 Valencia street between 22nd and 21st last week, I noticed something different about the signage on what used to be Flor de Cafe and Ma's Tacos.

Then this weekend when we walked by, they added a "Coming Soon" sign.

If the name [Mission's Kitchen](https://www.yelp.com/biz/missions-kitchen-san-francisco) sounds and the font looks familiar, that's because they already have a location on 2738 Mission street. There's usually a line there during peak hours on the weekend, so we've never been. But the ratings are good, so I look forward to their new location having a similar line. :-)
