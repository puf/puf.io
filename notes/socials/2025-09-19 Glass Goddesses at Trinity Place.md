As you walk southward on Market street you inevitably get to the 'sketchier' part of town, but there are still plenty of beautiful things to see here too.

At 1177 Market Street near 8th street is [Trinity Place][trinity-sf], a [huge housing complex][trinity-apt] with a treasure trove of art on its piazza including 7 gorgeous bollards called the [Glass Godesses][glass-godesses], by Lawrence Argent.

The glass structures contain carve-outs of classic greek sculptures, and they reflect the light that falls of them to spectacular effect. They're also lit from within at night, but I forgot to take a picture of that. :)

As you head southwest on the plaza, also take a look at the Escher-like marble flooring, which adds much to the effect - and can (unlike the glass statues) be clearly [seen on Google Maps][maps-mosaic] too.
