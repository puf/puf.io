[Glen Canyon Park][gcp] is a 66.6-acre recreation area located off of Elk Street and O'Shaughessy Boulevards in San Francisco. As its name hints at, it is built around Islais creek that sits between the slopes of Glen Park, Twin Peaks, and Diamond Heights neighborhoods.

While the southern part of the park has some developed areas, such as a recreation center, a playground, and tennis courts, I find the northern parts of the park more interesting. The moment you get north of the developments, you may wonder if you've been transported out of the city into one of the national parks with steep canyon on both sides of the trail.

The only thing that gives away that you're still in the city are that you can see the housing construction at the top of the hills. If you're willing to take the steep paths up those hills, you're right back in the city.

We like walking the canyon from the south to its northernmost exit onto Portola drive. On this walk you can appreciate the nature of the park, but also admire these houses-on-poles constructions:

If you're ever around, check these out. The picture doesn't do it justice, as these poles are easily 6 to 8 stories tall - and there are just a few of them keeping these houses up. ðŸ˜¬

If you follow the path all the way past [Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of The Arts][school] to Portola drive, you end up just under Sutro tower - which is always a beautiful sight.

You can continue the hike up the hill to Sutro tower, jump onto the [crosstown trail][ctt] (you're smack in the middle of [section 2][ctt-2]), head over to the shopping area a bit west, or (one of my favorites) walk back down to the mission over Clipper street, which gives you a gorgeous view over downtown San Francisco.
