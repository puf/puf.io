[Stagecoach Greens][site] is a miniature golf course in Mission Bay San Francisco, right next to the well known food truck field at [Spark Social][spark].

Opened in 2018, Stagecoach Greens is an 18 hole course themed around the origins and the current situation of San Francisco.

Each hole has its own theme and most of them are full of cool photo opportunities. 

The first 8 holes take you from this rocking stone to the Gold Rush era and how railroads connected the country.

Each of these holes is well developed, so be sure to take tons of pictures.

From hole 9 on the themes change to current San Francisco neighborhoods and landmarks. The theming becomes a bit more mixed/varied from here, but... it's hard not to appreciate playing your ball up the ramp of this Mission Bay shipyard.

*The hole being under a hanging container is very appropriate for a shipyard!*

After hole 9, closest to 3rd street, there's a non-playable photo opportunity too - showing the skyscrapers of SF downtown duking it out. Best of all, you can reach this without buying a ticket. 🤫📸🎟️

Those skyscrapers are also the theme of hole 10.

Hole 11 and 12 pay homage to Sutro Tower (note the "fog" like substance at its base) and the paddlers who follow the ballgame from their kayaks in McCovey Cove.

At hole 13 we putt out way through a very empty Golden Gate park. I guess if it was modelled more realistically it'd have a significantly higher par. That said, I love seeing the Conservatory of Flowers and the windmill in the back.

I initially thought that hole 14 was about Lombard street, but its "I felt that" name gives it away: it's about the earthquakes that have (and will) hit San Francisco and its surroundings.

Hole 16 reflects The Spirit of Invention really well, as you have to switch to pool style shooting through a pinball style maze.

Hole 17 is about Chinatown's Dragon's Gate, and also has another photo-op where you can pose for your selfie or portrait.

The final hole is (like in many mini golf courses) also a way for you to return your ball, in this case themed around peace and love and with a (real classic) fortune teller machine next to it. It immediately made me want to walk over to [Musée Mécanique][mm], but we'll save that for another time.

Stagecoach Greens is pretty compact, and fits in about half of the area between 3rd and 4th and Mission Bay Boulevard North and South. That area also hosts a number of food and drink stands too, so you can grab a bite/drink before starting your round.

Stagecoach Greens is open 7 days a week from 11 til 7, and from Wednesday til Saturday even until 9pm. Playing it costs $19 per adult and $13 per kid 12 and under. We rushed through it in about 25 minutes, but you're probably more likely to spend 45 to 60 minutes on it.
