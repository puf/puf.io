leadIn: "At first sight, the walk from 22nd street CalTrain station to my home in the Mission is a breeze. It's pretty much a straight line! But then I realized: that's Potrero hill in the middle there - so what will the climb/descent be like?"

On my commute back from the office in Mountain View home (Mission district San Francisco), I decided to walk home from 22nd street station. The distance seemed is perfect and it’s such a nice straight line on the map:

Well… that’s only until you look at the elevation map, or until you realize that this goes straight over San Francisco’s famous Potrero Hill.

It's really hard to do this justice, but that climb down is *really* steep: 15% - 20% on the stretch from [Kansas to Carolina](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Zn7HLVFUyLavgooK7).

I mean, the walk *is* beautiful and I made good progress in my audio-book, but this definitely is a sweat inducing walk - so more something for an evening route than a morning route, and even then if my wife isn't home before me.
