Every year since 2009 [Circus Bella][circusbella] has been delighting audiences across the San Francisco bay area with its annual [Circus in the Parks][citp] series.

We caught the 1pm show in [Salesforce park][salesforcepark] today. There was another show at 3pm, and they'll finish their season at [Radium Runway][radiumrunway] in Alameda next weekend (July 26, 2025).

Shows run for about an hour and are all free of charge, so spaces may fill up quickly. It's a smaller circus so don't expect Cirque-do-soleil type escapades. But the acts were all enjoyable, and it was a delight to see kids playing along.
