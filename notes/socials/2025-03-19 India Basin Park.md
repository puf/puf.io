[India Basin Waterfront Park][ibwp] is one of San Francisco's newest parks, right on the bay in the Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood. It's a bit interesting to get to, especially if you (or you rideshare) takes you though/by Hilltop Park. :-)

We were dropped off on Northridge road and followed the signs down to the park:

The park has of a waterfront area with some buildings and (lots of) signs. This area look like it'll be great once summer is here, with a food/drink area at the top, a large restroom area below, and lots of seating overlooking the water.

If you then turn left you can walk to the [India Basin Shoreline Park][ibsp], which has existed since 1990 or so. It was so incredibly green when we walked there, but that may depend on the season of course.

I found these metal maps/signs in this park very original, although not always easy to read. Since they're solid metal, there likely will be almost no wear on them from the weather.

If you keep going north over the Hunters Point Shoreline trail, you get to [Heron's Head Park][hhp] - another wetland area overlooking the bay.

We kept walking north through the India Basin industrial area, over the Islais Creek Channel, past [the Midway][midway-map] and into the Dogpatch.

While it was an interesting walk, after Heron's Head Park that was mostly due to it being an area we hadn't explored before. It wasn't a green as I thought it would be. I can't wait for these more southern parks to be connected to the strip of parks in Dogpatch and Mission Bay.
