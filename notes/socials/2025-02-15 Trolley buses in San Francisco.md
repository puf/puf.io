Reading this article recently about trolley busses: [Get Wired (Again): Trolleybuses and Trolleytrucks][ltm-trolley], I found myself somewhat surprised that San Francisco was in there as a city with trolley busses. And then I found myself surprised that I was surprised, because it's not hard to spot trolley busses in San Francisco. I clearly need to pay better attention as I walk around the city. ðŸ¤¯

The [Trolleybuses in San Francisco wikipedia page][wikipedia-trolley] has a good overview of them. Of course, leave it to San Francisco to also have the steepest grade of any trolley bus in the world:

> The system includes the single steepest known grade on any existing trolleybus line in the world (22.8% in the block of Noe Street between Cesar Chavez Street and 26th Street on route 24-Divisadero).

That is pretty close to where I live, and while I haven't ridden the trolley bus on that stretch, I can confirm that is it pretty steep. Here's a [Google Maps link][maps-steep], in case you want to check it out.

On the [bus stop on 22nd and Mission][bus-stop] pretty close to my house, both the MUNI line 14 and 49 apparently have trolleys riding on them. I ride line 49 regularly, but don't recall it ever being a trolley. But while waiting for my bus recently, this line 14 trolley showed up:

It's a bit hard to see, so here's a close up of its roof:

OK OK, the incredibly blue sky in the backdrop also doesn't hurt. ðŸ™‚ðŸŒž

This map by MUNI trolley owl shows that only line 5, 14, 22, and 24 currently have any trolleys riding on them.
