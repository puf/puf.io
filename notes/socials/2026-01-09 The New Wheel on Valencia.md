I only know The New Wheel electric bike shop from the flagship shop on Cortland avenue in Bernal Heights, but it turns out there are also stores in Marin and Oakland.

Well... another location is joining the fray, because [they're opening](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DR5NusOknrT/) a [The New Wheel shop and service center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BgekJJubhr3hfFR29) on 1031 Valencia street. It used to be a garden center before this, but I have a feeling The New Wheel will attract a lot more people.

The service center is opening on January 12, and the retail store on February 2.
