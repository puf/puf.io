On my commute back home from downtown Mountain View to the mission district in San Francisco, I did something new today! I took CalTrain from Mountain View as usual, but then transfered to the BART in Millbrae. I got off BART on 24th street, and then walked the last bit to 22nd and Guerrero.

It's a bit hard to see in the image above, but there's a transfer happening there at Millbrae from CalTrain to (the Red line of) BART. Here's what the planning for that transfer looks like:

Right, you can probably see why I don't usually take BART home - the transfer in Millbrae takes 29 minutes while it's only a 4 minute walk from the CalTrain platform to the BART platform.

Actually, it was even less of a walk than that - as this sign sent me right to the opposite track of where I got off the train.

There I just had to wait for 20 minutes or so, and believe me: the Millbrae platforms don't have *that* much of an interesting view. 

I really wish they'd make these schedules line up better.

Also note that little wiggle just north of Millbrae, right there:

This BART goes from Millbrae to SFO (San Francisco International Airport) where it turns around, which adds a few minutes to the trip. Oh, and it also does a big swerve to the left/west further up north to get around the San Bruno Mountain.

Why this route *is* interesting then? Well, it drops me off at 24th street and Mission, which means it's a lot closer to home than the 22nd street CalTrain station.

That said, I've walked from the 24th BART station so often by now, that I much prefer figuring out ways to get back from the CalTrain station on 22nd street back home. :)

*PS: hmmm.... did I see that correctly in the first image? Can I also take a route around the east bay? ðŸ¤” How long would that take?*
