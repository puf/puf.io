Yesterday I took a regular (non e-bike) Bay Wheels bicycle to get from my home in the Mission to the 22nd street CalTrain station. Last week [I took an e-bike](https://puf.io/socials/2024-08-06-bay-wheels-from-the-mission-to-the-22nd-street-caltrain-station/), so this was my comparison/calibration ride.

I took the exact same route this time north on Valencia, then east on 17th, and back down Kansas street to 22nd, but somehow it felt like there were a lot more uphill stretches in there now. :-)

One thing I didn’t like about the e-bike is that it took almost no physical effort, and I definitely got more exercise on a regular bike, especially on the stretch on 17th from Treat to Potrero avenue.

Oh, and this is what the Bay Wheels app claims my route was. Right over that peak of Potrero Hill. If it’s hard to walk, it’s definitely not a good bike route, folks!

Surprisingly, it took me almost the same time as with an e-bike. That might have to do with following the advice from @daveagram that [“stop signs are car infrastructure”.](https://www.threads.net/@daveagram/post/C-T9UwdJzn1) I didn’t rush through them though as I saw some others do. /smh

I had some problems getting my bike locked, but it worked on the third try. And the price came down to a much more reasonable $4.33 (vs $10 for the e-bike ride). And as others commented, with a subscription this ride would’ve been free.
