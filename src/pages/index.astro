				Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Frank van Puffelen, more commonly known as <em>puf</em> and 
				I'm a Firebase engineer at Google. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm mostly known for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen">answering questions</a> on Stack Overflow,
				my monthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-K7zZEsYLm9G2M1W5ztrDvMv-CiFzLM">Firebase Release Notes</a> videos, and
				as a speaker about Firebase and Flutter at large and small conferences around the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is my personal web site, and yes indeed - it is rather bare at the moment...
